"""
The cursor of a pane: its shape, and whether it blinks.

Two sequences write the same cursor. DECSCUSR ("CSI Ps SP q") names the
shape and the blinking in one number. Private mode 12 names only the
blinking. So both write `cursor_style`, and every reader gets one
answer: the blinking shapes are the odd numbers, and the steady one of
a pair is the number after it.

The pane keeps this, and what draws the pane puts it on the terminal of
the user.
