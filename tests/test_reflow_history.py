"""
Widening a screen pulls history back onto it.

A wide screen needs fewer rows for the same text. The rows that come
free are filled from the history above, and the cursor stays on the row
it was on. That is what a user sees when they widen a window: the prompt
does not move, and more of what scrolled away comes back.

libvterm is the only oracle here. No judge on the panel can be resized,
so a reflow has no vote to read (Lillecarl/pymux#64).

libvterm agrees, but only when it has a history. Its `69screen_reflow`
test asks for `WANTSCREEN r`, which turns reflow on and leaves the
scrollback off, so `sb_popline` in `t/harness.c` returns 0 and
`src/screen.c` falls back to moving the text to the top. Give the same
harness `WANTSCREEN rb` and the same bytes, and it pops a line, fills
the top row and puts the cursor at `4,2`, which is what these tests
assert. Lillecarl/pymux#57.
