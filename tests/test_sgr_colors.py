"""
The colour arithmetic of SGR, on its own.

"SGR 38", "48" and "58" carry a colour in one of two forms, and how
many parameters each form takes decides where the next attribute
starts. That is arithmetic on numbers: no sequence is read and none is
written, so it lives in `pyte/colors.py` beside the palette.

What a screen does with the answer is the other half. It keeps the
number, and `ptterm/style.py` spells it as a prompt_toolkit style
word, because the spelling belongs to whoever draws.

`test_indexed_colors.py` and `test_colon_colors.py` judge the whole
path through a screen. This file judges the arithmetic alone, so a
failure says which half is wrong.
