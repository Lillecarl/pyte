"""
A backspace in the first column, and the two modes that let it wrap.

A backspace normally stops in the first column. Two private modes send
it to the end of the line above instead, so that a program can rub out
a line it wrapped:

- "?45" goes back only over a line that was reached by wrapping. The
  backspace undoes the typing and stops where the typing began.
- "?1045" goes back over any line, and from the top of the scrolling
  region to the bottom of it.

xterm carried only "?45", with the "?1045" behaviour, until 2023. It
then split the two apart, because a program that wanted to rub out a
wrapped line did not want the cursor leaving the line it typed.
