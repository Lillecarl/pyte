"""
XTGETTCAP ("DCS + q <names> ST"): what this terminal can do.

A program that wants to know whether it may draw a curly underline has
two ways to find out. It can read the terminfo database of the machine
it runs on, which says what `TERM` names and may not have the entry at
all. Or it can ask the terminal, which always knows.

The second way is the only one that survives ssh, and it is what
modern programs use. The answer has to be true: a capability that is
claimed and not served is worse than one that is missing, because the
program stops asking and draws what the terminal cannot draw.
