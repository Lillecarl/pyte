"""
The cells that an erase has to leave alone.

Two commands mark a cell. SPA ("ESC V") sets the mark of ISO 6429, and
ED, EL and ECH leave a cell that carries it alone. DECSCA ("CSI 1 " q")
sets the mark of the DEC terminals, and the selective erases, DECSED
("CSI ? Ps J") and DECSEL ("CSI ? Ps K"), leave that one alone.

A selective erase reads both marks. xterm does the same, for the
programs that came before DECSCA.
