"""
What "CSI Ps n" and "CSI ? Ps n" answer.

DSR asks the terminal about itself. Most of the questions are about a
part that a pane does not have: a printer, a keyboard, a locator, a
macro store. Each of those has a legal answer that says "no", and a
terminal has to give it.

A query with no answer is worse than a wrong answer. The program waits
for one, and every answer after it arrives one place out of step. That
is why the whole class of these tests failed while only some of them
were missing.
