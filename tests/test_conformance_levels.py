"""
DECSCL: which DEC terminal this one answers as.

Each level is one DEC terminal, and a higher level carries everything
the levels below it carry and more. A program that asks for an earlier
terminal loses the sequences that came later.

pyte does not drop every later sequence. It drops the three that
esctest2 asks about, because a program that asks for a VT220 and then
finds a VT520 has learned nothing from asking.
