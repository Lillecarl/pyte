"""
The three ways a program asks a pane to change size.

DECSLPP ("CSI Ps t", Ps of 24 or more) asks for a page of that many
lines. "CSI 8 ; Ph ; Pw t" asks for rows and columns. "CSI 4 ; Ph ;
Pw t" asks for as many cells as fit in that many pixels.

A pane cannot resize itself. It sits in a layout that somebody else
owns, and making one pane taller makes another shorter. So the ask
goes to `resize_func` and the embedder decides. With no embedder the
ask goes nowhere.
