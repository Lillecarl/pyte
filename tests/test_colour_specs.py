"""
Judge the colour spec parser against the real Xlib.

`pyte/xcms.py` is a port. A port is only right where it agrees with
what it copies, so this asks libX11 the same question and compares the
two answers.

The check starts an Xvfb for this. Without one the tests skip, and the
build says so, because a judge that cannot run proves nothing.
