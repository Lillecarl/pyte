"""
The terminfo entry that describes a pane.

Two readers, one table. `screen.report_capabilities` answers a program
that asks over the wire, and this entry answers one that reads the
database instead. They come from `CAPABILITIES`, so they cannot say
different things.

The check that matters is that `tic` takes the entry: a source file
with one comma wrong compiles to nothing, and a pane whose `TERM`
names an entry that is not there is worse off than one that says
`xterm-256color`.
