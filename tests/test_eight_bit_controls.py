"""
The form of a C1 control that a reply carries.

Every C1 control has two spellings. Seven bits is `ESC` and a letter,
and eight bits is the single byte 0x40 above that letter: `CSI` is
`ESC [` or 0x9b. S8C1T ("ESC SP G") picks the second, S7C1T
("ESC SP F") picks the first, and DECSCL sets the same thing.

The mode exists so that a program can parse an answer without the
escape. It only works when it reaches every control the terminal
writes, which is why one helper spells all of them.

An eight bit control is a byte and not a character, so UTF-8 has no
spelling for it. It travels as a surrogate, and the backend encodes it
back with "surrogateescape". These tests read the wire, not the string.

libvterm's `26state_query.test` line 62 asks the same question.
