"""
DECCOLM: the 80 and 132 column page, and the mode that allows it.

A DEC terminal has two page widths, and DECCOLM ("?3") picks one. It
clears the screen and puts the cursor home either way.

xterm keeps the width behind private mode 40, because a program that
sets DECCOLM by accident would otherwise throw the screen away. pyte
does the same, and asks the embedder for the room rather than taking
it: a pane sits in a layout and cannot decide its own size.
