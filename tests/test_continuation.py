"""
The mark that says a line continues the one above it.

A line that a wrap started is a continuation. The mark decides what a
resize joins back together, so a mark that is wrong is a screen that is
wrong from the next resize onwards.

An erase that clears the end of a line ends the wrap out of it: nothing
wrapped away any more, so the line below is a line of its own.

libvterm's `32state_flow.test` is the only thing that asks. No judge on
the panel reports the mark, and it is visible from the outside only
through a resize. Lillecarl/pymux#58.
