"""
The terminfo entry that describes this screen.

A program has two ways to learn what a terminal can do. It can ask,
which `screen.report_capabilities` answers, or it can read the
database of the machine it runs on, which is what every program built
on ncurses does.

This writes the entry for the second way, out of the same table that
answers the first. One source, two readers: the database and the wire
cannot say different things.

Compile it with:

    python -m pyte.terminfo | tic -x -o <directory> -

The entry names `xterm-256color` as its parent, because that is what a
pane emulates apart from the capabilities below. `tic` copies the
parent in, so what comes out stands on its own.
