    A dictionary that makes what it does not hold, and keeps `size`.

    The key is the argument list of `get_value`, so a lookup that
    misses calls it and keeps the answer. Nothing counts accesses: the
    oldest key goes when the cache is full.

    It is for a small object that is cheap to make and expensive to
    make a million times. A cell is that: a screen of 80 by 24 makes
    1920 of them, and nearly every one is a repeat.

    screen is not a toolkit's. Lillecarl/pymux#11.
