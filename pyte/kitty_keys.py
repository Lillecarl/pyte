"""
Key data translation for the kitty keyboard protocol.

The process running inside a pane can request the kitty keyboard
protocol (pushing flags with "CSI > flags u", tracked by BetterScreen).
The terminal that feeds us key data (the multiplexer client of pymux,
or any other prompt_toolkit application) can send keys in the legacy
encoding, in the kitty CSI u encoding, or a mix of both. This module
translates raw key data into the encoding that the pane expects:

- flags == 0: legacy encoding. Kitty CSI u sequences are translated to
  their legacy equivalents; everything else passes through verbatim.
- flags & 0b1 (disambiguate): escape and ctrl/alt combinations are
  encoded as CSI u. Text keys and plain Enter/Tab/Backspace stay
  legacy, as the spec requires.
- flags & 0b1000 (report all keys as escape codes): everything is
  encoded as CSI u.

Three parts of a key event need a terminal that speaks the protocol:
the event type (press, repeat or release), the other codes of the key
(the shifted key and the key of the base layout), and the text that
the key writes. What such a terminal sends passes through to a pane
that asked for it, and goes away for a pane that did not.

All three are served for a legacy terminal as well, as far as it can:

- The text of a printable key needs nothing. The character that the
  terminal sends is that text.
- A key release is made up. The legacy encoding says that a key went
  down and never that it came up, so a key answers with a press and a
  release at once. The pane reads every key going down and coming up;
  only the time between the two is lost. `translate_key_data` takes
  `synthesize=False` to leave that off.
- The shifted key of a letter is the letter. Which key gives an
  exclamation mark depends on the layout of the user, and that the
  legacy encoding does not carry, so such a key reports no other code.
  kitty reports none either for a key that has none.

The forms follow the encoder of kitty (`kitty/key_encoding.c`), so a
pane sees what a real kitty gives it.
