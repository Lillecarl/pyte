"""
What a colour is, how a spec of X11 becomes one, and which colour each
SGR code names.

A pane answers colour queries, so it has to read the colour that a
program names and write the colour that it holds. Neither job is about
a terminal: the syntax is `XParseColor`'s, the arithmetic is Xcms's,
and the palette is a table. `xcms.py` holds the arithmetic that this
one calls, and `osc.py` holds the sequences that carry the answers.

The second half is the translation between an SGR code and the colour
it names. "SGR 31" is the first colour of the palette and "SGR 38;5;n"
is the nth, and both are numbers here. **No spelling lives in this
file.** How a renderer writes a colour is that renderer's, and
`style.py` holds prompt_toolkit's answer.

Nothing here reads or writes a sequence.
