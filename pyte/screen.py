"""
The screen: what a program has drawn, cell by cell.

**It parses and holds, and it draws nothing.** No I/O, no toolkit, and
no opinion about how a cell is spelled for a renderer. A cell holds an
`Appearance`, which is a model; `ptterm/style.py` spells one for
prompt_toolkit and `txterm/style.py` builds a `rich.style.Style` from
the same object, and neither reads a word the other wrote.

That is why this file is here and not in a widget. Lillecarl/pymux#11.

It replaces the `Screen` of upstream pyte, which is gone. What was
different, and is now simply what this package does:
    - The cells live in a `Page`, one per screen, so a swap to the
      alternate screen carries the cells and the cursor together.
    - 256 colours, true colour, and colours a program names itself.
    - CPR, device attributes, and the other reports a program reads.

#: this code lived inside the multiplexer, and that was already wrong:
#: what the entry describes is what the screen below draws, which is the
#: same whether pymux arranged the pane, a prompt_toolkit widget holds
#: it, or a Textual one does.
#:
#: **"256color" is deliberately not in this name**, and the pictures of
#: a real terminal are what says so.
#:
#: tmux and screen both put it in theirs, and the habit comes from when
#: 8, 16, 88 and 256 were the axis a terminal varied on. A lot of
#: software still reads the substring out of `TERM` rather than opening
#: the database. That cuts both ways, and in a pane it cuts the wrong
#: way: **a screen takes 24 bit colour**, and a program that reads
#: "256color" picks the nearest index of the palette itself and writes
#: that index. The colour a program meant is then lost before the pane
#: ever sees it. `pymux/main.py` sets `COLORTERM=truecolor` for exactly
#: that reason, and a name that says 256 argues with it.
#:
#: Measured: with "pyte-256color" in `TERM`, `checks.pymux-pictures`
#: found about 5700 pixels of difference on the colour fixture in both
#: foot and kitty, and on two recordings of real programs. With "pyte"
#: there is none. xterm shows nothing either way, because it cannot
#: draw a colour of its own anyway.
#:
#: The name that does mean direct colour is `xterm-direct`, and it is
#: not one to take: it sets `colors#0x1000000` and **redefines `setaf`
#: and `setab` so the argument is a packed colour and not a place in
#: the palette**. Every program that uses the palette draws the wrong
#: thing under it.
#:
#: So the palette is claimed where a claim belongs, in the entry: the
#: parent is `xterm-256color`, and `RGB` and `Tc` in `CAPABILITIES` say
#: the rest. `TERMINAL_ALIAS` is the spelling with the suffix, which

        the cell; Alacritty, Ghostty, libvterm and xterm do not. Four to
        two is a choice and not a rule, and a program that reverses and
        then erases means the block to be seen.

        DCH and ICH read this style as well, and the panel splits there
        too. Ghostty and WezTerm colour a delete with nothing at all,
        not even the background, so they take no side. Of the five that
        do colour it, kitty and ptterm paint the reverse, libvterm keeps
        the foreground without it, and Alacritty and xterm keep only the
        background. Alacritty's `delete_chars_reset` reference test is
        that difference and nothing else: twelve cells at the end of one
        row.

        `None` means that nothing paints the cell, so the cell can go
        away instead, which keeps the screen sparse.

        A hyperlink is never part of it. An erase takes the content of
        a cell away, and a link that covers nothing is not a link.
